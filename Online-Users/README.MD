* I used a local json file to generate a "friend list".  
* Modified the json file so that the users have an online status of true or false.  
* Added the usernames in a list of items using flex column.  
* Added a circle in front of the username that indicates the user's status: green for online and red for offline(also added a little animation on the offline status using keyframes: it changes the opacity from 1 at the beginning to 0.1 at halfway and return to 1, creating a pulsating effect).  
* Added two buttons to sort the users: one for sorting alphabetically and one for the online status.
