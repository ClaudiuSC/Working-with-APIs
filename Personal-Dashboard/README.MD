A chrome extension that acts like a personal dashboard.

It uses 3 APIs:
* Unsplash, to get a background image and the name of the person who made that image;
* Coingecko, to get the value of a Bitcoin;
* Openweather, to get the temperature and location of the user(using latitude and longitude obtained through the navigator.getgeolocation API in JS), also shows and icon representative of the weather and time of day.
