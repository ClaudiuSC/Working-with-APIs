V1:
An application that uses an API to search for tv shows(it displays the most relevant show that it finds). I used grid to display the content.

V2 changes:
- linked the logo to the index.html;
- the search function now displays up to 10 results in a list(10 is the limit of the API);
- the search field displays a message through the placeholder attribute if the field is empty;
- each title from the result list is linked with the show's content;
- the show's content now features a "back" arrow that renders the search results back on the page;
- to display the search list and the show's content in the same div i modified the css property grid-auto-rows.

**Requires refactoring
